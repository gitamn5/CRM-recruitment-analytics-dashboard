# CRM-recruitment-analytics-dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing recruitment and applicant data to provide actionable insights for HR teams.  
I worked on **data cleaning, formatting, and storing** the dataset in **Excel** and **Google Sheets**, and then connected the cleaned dataset to **Google Looker Studio** to build an interactive CRM-style recruitment dashboard.

The dashboard tracks:
- Applicant selection and rejection trends
- Company-wise applicant performance
- Job role preferences
- Source of applications
- Expected salary insights
- Work mode preferences (On-site / Remote / Hybrid)
- Education and city-level breakdown
